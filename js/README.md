## FreeCodeCamp: JavaScript Calculator

I built an interactive JavaScript Calculator with jQuery, HTML and CSS, while following some best practices for structuring HTML, writing efficient CSS, and commenting code along the way.

 User can add, subtract, multiply, divide, percentage two numbers, clear the input field with a clear button, and keep chaining mathematical operations together until user hit the equal button, and the calculator will give the correct output.
